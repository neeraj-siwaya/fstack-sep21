When a class is loaded, following tasks are performed by JRE:

1. Static data members if defined in the class, are created in the class area.
2. Static block if defined in the class, is executed.
3. The task because of which the class is loaded, is performed.


In a class,order of members doesn't matter i.e. members in a class can be defined in any order but the 
order of statements in a method or constructor matters. Statements are executed in the order they
are defined.

Argument Passing mechanism of Java:
1. Primitive arguments (char, int, short, long, byte, float, double and boolean) 
are passed by value i.e. their copy is created in the invoked method.
2. Objects are passed by references i.e. same object is refered by another
name in the invoked method.

We can use the following examples to understand the differences of these two approaces:

Problem statement: 
1. Define a class named Swapper which has a method named swap to swap two integers.
2. Define another class named SwapperTest which has main() method. In the main() method, 2 integers
are created and initialized and swapped using the swap() method of the Swapper class.

As seen in the last example we can't get the values of two integers swapped through a method because
copy of integers is passed to the method. 
If want to swap them, we need to convert integer values to objects because when objects are passed to
methods their copy is not created.
To convert integers to objects we can define a class as follows:


this keyword: 

In Java, each non static method and constructor has an implicit parameter (which is not defined but can be used)
by the name this. It receives the reference of the invoking object in the method.
It has following uses:

1. It is used to refer data members of the object in case local variables and data members have same name.
syntax of referencing the data members of the invoking object:

this.memberName

2. It is used for intra-class (within class) constructor chaining.
Constructor chaining is the facility of invoking a constructor from another constructor. Intra-class constructor 
chaining is used when there are multiple constructors in a class i.e. constructors are overloaded.
If we have n datamembers and m constructors in a class then without constructor chaining, n*m statements
are required for initialization.
With the help of constructor chaining, these statements can be reduced to n+m-1.

syntax of invoking a same class constructor from another constructor:
this(arguments if any); // It must be the first statement of the invoking constructor

3. It is used for method chaining

Method chaining is the facility of invoking multiple methods on an object in a single statement.

e.g. obj be an object on which m1(), m2() and m3() methods are to be invoked.
Without method chaining:
obj.m1();
obj.m2();
obj.m3();

With method chaining:
obj.m1().m2().m3();

Relation b/w classes can be of two types:

Is-A Relation
Has-A Relation

e.g. 
Car is a Vehicle, is an example of Is-A relation.
Car has engine, is an example of Has-A relation.

Today, we will explore Is-A relation.

Is-A relation is implemented with the help of inheritance i.e. if a class inherits anohter class then
Is-A relation is created b/w them.

In Java, extends keyword is used for inheritance.

syntax:

class ClassName extends SuperClassName{

    Additional methods
       or
    Additional data members and methods   
}

e.g. class A{

    public void one(){
        System.out.println("It is one of A");
    }
}

class B extends A{
    public void two(){
        System.out.println("It is two of B");
    }
}

Here B is inheriting A i.e. we can use one() as well two() methods with the object of B.
Inheritance is used for code reusability and run time polymorphism.

Inheritance can be of different types such as:

1. Multiple Inheritance
2. Multilevel Inheritance
3. Hybrid Inheritance

When a class extends more than one classes, it is known as multiple inheritance. In Java,
Multiple inheritance is not supported.

we can't do the following in Java:

class X{
    // some members
   
}

class Y{
    // some members
    
}

class Z extends X,Y{
    //won't compile

}

When a class extends another class which extends another class and so on then it is known as Multilevel
inheritance.

Utility of inheritance can be understood with the help of following example:

Problem Statement:

We need to define Rectangle and Cuboid classes to represent rectangles and cuboids as objects.

There can be following approaches:

1. Independent classes are defined for Rectangle and Cuboid
2. Both Rectangle and Cuboid have length & breadth, we can define a common class for length and breadth
and can inherit it in both Rectangle and Cuboid. 

class Common{

    int length, breadth;

    public Common(int l, int b){
        length =l;
        breadth =b;
    }
    public void display(){
        System.out.println("Lenght: "+length);
        System.out.println("Breadth: "+breadth);
    }
}

class Rectangle extends Common{

    public Rectangle(int l, int b){
        super(l,b); // Parent class constructor is inovked
    }
    //Additonal behaviour is defiend
    public int area(){
        return length * breadth;
    }
    public int perimeter(){
        return 2*(length * breadth);
    }
}

class Cuboid extends Common{

// additional attribute is defined
    int height;

    public Cuboid(int l, int b, int h){
        super(l,b); // Parent class constructor is inovked
        height = h;
    }
//Additonal behaviour is defiend
public void display(){
        super.display(); // Super class method is invoked.
        System.out.println("height: "+height);
    }
 public int volume(){
     return length * breadth * height;
 }   
}

public class InheritanceTest{
    public static void main(String arr[]){
        System.out.println("Creating Rectangle object r...");
        Rectangle r = new Rectangle(4,5);
         System.out.println("Creating Cuboid object c...");
        Cuboid c = new Cuboid(10, 20, 30);
        System.out.println("Dimension of Rectangle");
        r.display();
         System.out.println("Dimension of Cuboid");
        c.display();
        System.out.println("Area of Rectangle is: "+r.area());
        System.out.println("Volume of Cuboid is: "+c.volume());
    }
} 


Uses of super keyword:

1. It is used to inovke super class constructor from a sub class constructor.

syntax:  super(args if any);

Note- It must be the first statement of a sub class constructor.

2. It is used to invoke a super class method from a sub class method.

syntax: super.methodName(args if any);

3. It is used to refer super class data members in a subclass when there is a 
name conflict b/w super class and sub class data members.

syntax: super.memberName


Method Overriding: When a sub class defines a method having the same
signature as a method of its super class then the sub class is said to 
be Overriding the method of its super class.

Method Overriding is one of the means of implementing polymorphism. Methods are
overridden by sub classes to perform a task in different way than their parent class.

In our example, Cuboid class is Overriding the display() method.

When a class inherits another class then in addition to the features, it also inherits the
name of its super class i.e. Objects of subclass can be referenced by the name of super class.

e.g. let there be following classes:

class A {

}

class B extends A{

}

class C extends B {

}

Objects of these classes can be referenced as follows:

ObjectType              ReferenceType
1. A                     A, Object
e.g. A x = new A();
     Object y = new A();

2. B                     B, A, Object 
e.g. B x = new B();
     A y = new B();
     Object z = new B();

3. C                    C, B, A, Object
e.g. C x = new C();
     B y = new C();
     A z = new C(); 
     Object o = new C();


In java, each class is inherited from java.lang.Object class i.e. Object is the implicit super class 
of all java classes. It contains  attributes and behaviour common to all java objects.

Each time object of any class is created, it inherits the featurs of all its parent classes up to the
object class which means whenever the object is created all the constrcturs starting from the Object
class up to the instiated class must be executed so that the object is properly initialized.

At the time of compilation, compiler checks each class for constrctur chaining with Object class.
If chaining is not there then compilation error is generated.

Object class has only a default constrctur so if a class doesn't explictly invoke super()/this() from
its constrcturs then compiler adds super() as the first statement to all the constrcutors of the class.

Static & Dynamic binding:

At the time of compilation, compiler links each method call to a method definition. This 
process is known as binding.

If the compiler is able to bind a method call then it is known as static or early binding.
Sometimes due to some ambiguity, compiler is not able to bind a method call and defers it
till the time of execution. At the time of execution, JRE binds the method call to a 
definition. It is known as dynamic or late binding.

How method calls are binded:

1. If a call has only one interpretation and will continue to have only one interpretation 
in future, it is statically binded.

2. If a call has multiple interpretations or may have multiple interpretations in future then 
it is dynamically binded.

Compiler uses following rules for deciding binding:

1. Calls of constrcturs are statically binded.
2. Calls of private methods are statically binded
3. Calls of static methods are statically binded
4. Calls which are made using super keyword (super.methodName()) are statically binded.
5. All other calls are dynamically binded.

following example can be used to understand static & dynamic binding:

class A{
    public void display()
    {
        System.out.println("In A");
    }
    public void display(String str){
        System.out.println(str);
    }
    public static void invoke(A obj){
       obj.display(); //Will be dynamically binded
    }
}
class B extends A{
    public void display()
    {
        System.out.println("In B");
    }
}


public class Invoker {
    
     public static void main(String args[]) {
     A x = new A();
     A.invoke(x);//Will be statically binded
     A y = new B();
     A.invoke(y);//Will be statically binded
    }
}
